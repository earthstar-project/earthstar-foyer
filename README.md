# Earthstar Foyer

Status: in progress

A guestbook-style web application built with [Earthstar](https://github.com/cinnamon-bun/earthstar).

Compatible with [earthstar-lobby](https://github.com/sgwilym/earthstar-lobby/).  It uses the same document paths and data format.  However it can only use some of the same pubs, not all:

| app                | plain pubs | GraphQL pubs |
| -------------------|------------|--------------|
| this app           | yes        | ðŸš« not yet   |
| `earthstar-lobby`  | yes        | yes          |

## Live demo

https://earthstar-foyer.netlify.app/
